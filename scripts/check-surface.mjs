/**
 * Diff the mirrors in test/allowlist.ts against the platform's published
 * surface manifest — the routes, the parameters each route takes, and the
 * numeric limits this SDK refuses against.
 *
 * The mirror is what keeps this SDK honest about what exists, and a mirror
 * nobody compares is just a comment. That is not hypothetical:
 * `computers/:id/exec/:pid` (both verbs) and `GET computers/:id/snapshots`
 * reached the platform without any SDK's surface test noticing, because "every
 * call lands on an allowlisted route" stays true when the allowlist is the stale
 * one. mandala-computer-python and mandala-computer-mcp have their own copies of
 * this check, so all three now say so.
 *
 * The parameter half exists because the route half was not enough. Every route
 * was reachable and four documented parameters were not: `stop?force`,
 * `screenshot?fresh`, `exec`'s `env` and a snapshot's `name`. A route table
 * cannot see any of them — the call lands on the right route either way, and
 * the only thing missing is the argument that made it worth making. Two of the
 * four were the difference between a call that works and a call that works
 * wrongly and says nothing: a graceful stop for a guest that will not come
 * down, and a cached frame for a model deciding where to click next.
 *
 * The limits half is new (OPL-4850) and closes the same kind of hole one step
 * further out. `src/paths.ts` turns away a clipboard write over 64 KiB and an
 * env list over 64 entries before the request is made, to save the caller a
 * round trip. Nothing compared those numbers to the platform's, so a ceiling
 * that drifted upward would have this SDK refusing calls the platform would
 * have taken — with no failure anywhere, because the request that would have
 * proved it is the one never sent.
 *
 * Exits 0 and says so when the platform repo is not checked out. That is the
 * ordinary case in CI on this repository, and failing over it would make the
 * check something people learn to ignore. What is not that case is an operator
 * who named a directory: `MANDALA_PLATFORM_REPO` is an assertion that the repo
 * is at that path, and a path that turns out not to hold it is a mistake to
 * report rather than a repo to go looking for elsewhere.
 *
 * Where it is enforced is the platform's own CI, which checks this repo out
 * beside itself and runs this script against it (OPL-3916). That is deliberate
 * rather than incidental: what this prints is the routes, parameters and limits
 * that have not shipped yet, and this repository's Actions logs are
 * world-readable the day it goes public, where the platform's are not. Running
 * it here would also put a read key for a private repo inside a public one,
 * which is the wrong direction for a credential to point.
 *
 * So on a machine that has both this is what catches drift before a push, and
 * everywhere else it is what the platform runs.
 *
 * NOTHING HERE PARSES TYPESCRIPT ANY MORE (OPL-4850)
 * =================================================
 *
 * This script used to read the platform's `web/lib/surface.ts` and
 * `web/lib/apidoc.ts` as TEXT, through ~760 lines of hand-written scanner in
 * `scripts/surface-text.mjs`, and to read its own mirror with regexes over
 * `test/allowlist.ts`.
 *
 * Across eleven adversarial review rounds that scanner produced, and then
 * closed, at least a dozen distinct FAIL-OPENS — runs that printed "the mirror
 * matches the platform" without having read it. A `.concat` after the leading
 * array. A decoy table inside a type annotation. A projection callback that
 * ignored its argument. `.add` after the constructor. An extra callback
 * parameter whose default ran. A computed key in a destructured parameter. A
 * type assertion that was really a comparison chain. A line comment ended by a
 * carriage return. Each was fixed and the next spelling arrived, because
 * recognising TypeScript is a TypeScript parser's job and this was not one.
 *
 * Both sides are now read rather than recognised:
 *
 * - The platform's, from `surface-manifest.json` (platform OPL-4827), which it
 *   generates from the same tables its API reference and OpenAPI document are
 *   built from. One `JSON.parse`.
 * - This repo's, by importing `test/allowlist.ts` directly. Node strips the
 *   types; the tables arrive as the objects the suite itself uses, so there is
 *   no second reading of the mirror that can disagree with the first.
