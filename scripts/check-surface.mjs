/**
 * Diff the mirrors in test/allowlist.ts against the platform's surface manifest
 * — the routes, and the parameters each route takes.
 *
 * The mirror is what keeps this SDK honest about what exists, and a mirror
 * nobody compares is just a comment. That is not hypothetical:
 * `computers/:id/exec/:pid` (both verbs) and `GET computers/:id/snapshots`
 * reached the platform without any SDK's surface test noticing, because "every
 * call lands on an allowlisted route" stays true when the allowlist is the stale
 * one. The parameter half exists because the route half was not enough: four
 * documented parameters were unreachable on routes the SDK reached, and a route
 * table cannot see any of them.
 *
 * What this compares against is the platform's `surface-manifest.json`: a file
 * the platform generates from its own tables, verifies byte-for-byte in its own
 * suite, and commits like a lockfile — the routes, the parameters per route, and
 * its limits keyed by what each number means. This used to be a scanner over
 * the platform's TypeScript source, read as text with no parser, and every
 * review of it found another construct it read wrong. The manifest is the
 * platform saying what its surface is, once, in a form a client can read without
 * guessing.
 *
 * The mirror is IMPORTED, not scanned: Node strips the types off
 * test/allowlist.ts itself (22.18 and later), so the tables compared are the
 * ones the suite pins, and a second reader over them cannot disagree with it.
 *
 * FAIL-CLOSED. The recurring defect in the scanners was a false all-clear —
 * reporting the mirror in step because the scan had silently read nothing — and
 * a JSON diff can do that too. So a manifest that is missing, unparseable, of a
 * version this does not know, with no routes, with a parameter on a route it
 * does not list, or a comparison that ends up covering zero parameters, is a
 * failure that names the problem, never an empty comparison that passes.
 *
 * Exits 0 and says so when the platform repo is not checked out. That is the
 * ordinary case in CI on this repository, and failing over it would make the
 * check something people learn to ignore. What is not that case is an operator
 * who named a directory: `MANDALA_PLATFORM_REPO` is an assertion that the repo
 * is at that path, and a path that turns out not to hold it is a mistake to
 * report rather than a repo to go looking for elsewhere.
 *
 * Where it is enforced is the platform's own CI, which checks this repo out
 * beside itself and runs this script against it. What this prints is the routes
 * and parameters that have not shipped yet, and this repository's Actions logs
 * are world-readable where the platform's are not — so the comparison runs
 * there, and here it is what catches drift before a push.
