/**
 * Diff the mirrors in test/allowlist.ts against the real tables in the platform
 * repo — the routes, and the parameters each route takes.
 *
 * The mirror is what keeps this SDK honest about what exists, and a mirror
 * nobody compares is just a comment. That is not hypothetical:
 * `computers/:id/exec/:pid` (both verbs) and `GET computers/:id/snapshots`
 * reached the platform without any SDK's surface test noticing, because "every
 * call lands on an allowlisted route" stays true when the allowlist is the stale
 * one. mandala-computer-python has since grown its own checker
 * (`scripts/check_surface.py`) and mandala-computer-mcp has a copy of this one,
 * so all three now say so.
 *
 * The parameter half exists because the route half was not enough. Every route
 * was reachable and four documented parameters were not: `stop?force`,
 * `screenshot?fresh`, `exec`'s `env` and a snapshot's `name`. A route table
 * cannot see any of them — the call lands on the right route either way, and
 * the only thing missing is the argument that made it worth making. Two of the
 * four were the difference between a call that works and a call that works
 * wrongly and says nothing: a graceful stop for a guest that will not come
 * down, and a cached frame for a model deciding where to click next.
 *
 * Exits 0 and says so when the platform repo is not checked out. That is the
 * ordinary case in CI on this repository, and failing over it would make the
 * check something people learn to ignore. What is not that case is an operator
 * who named a directory: `MANDALA_PLATFORM_REPO` is an assertion that the repo
 * is at that path, and a path that turns out not to hold it is a mistake to
 * report rather than a repo to go looking for elsewhere.
 *
 * Where it is enforced is the platform's own CI, which checks this repo out
 * beside itself and runs this script against it (OPL-3916). That is deliberate
 * rather than incidental: what this prints is the routes, parameters and
 * constant values that have not shipped yet, and this repository's Actions logs
 * are world-readable the day it goes public, where the platform's are not.
 * Running it here would also put a read key for a private repo inside a public
 * one, which is the wrong direction for a credential to point.
 *
 * So on a machine that has both this is what catches drift before a push, and
 * everywhere else it is what the platform runs.
