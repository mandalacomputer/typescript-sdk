/**
 * Diff the mirrors in test/allowlist.ts against the real tables in the platform
 * repo — the routes, and the parameters each route takes.
 *
 * The mirror is what keeps this SDK honest about what exists, and a mirror
 * nobody compares is just a comment. mandala-computer-python has the mirror and
 * not this script, which is how `computers/:id/exec/:pid` (both verbs) and
 * `GET computers/:id/snapshots` reached the platform without its surface test
 * ever noticing — the test kept passing, because "every call lands on an
 * allowlisted route" stays true when the allowlist is the stale one.
 *
 * The parameter half exists because the route half was not enough. Every route
 * was reachable and four documented parameters were not: `stop?force`,
 * `screenshot?fresh`, `exec`'s `env` and a snapshot's `name`. A route table
 * cannot see any of them — the call lands on the right route either way, and
 * the only thing missing is the argument that made it worth making. Two of the
 * four were the difference between a call that works and a call that works
 * wrongly and says nothing: a graceful stop for a guest that will not come
 * down, and a cached frame for a model deciding where to click next.
 *
 * Exits 0 and says so when the platform repo is not checked out. That is the
 * ordinary case in CI on this repository, and failing over it would make the
 * check something people learn to ignore. Where it matters is on a machine that
 * has both, and in any job that checks out both.

// --- reading TypeScript without a TypeScript loader -------------------------

// Both files are read as text and matched over, so this runs with no build step
// and no dependency. Comments are stripped from anything matched, because both
// are heavily commented and several of those comments quote the very shapes
// being matched — over them, the regexes invent routes and parameters. See
// scripts/surface-text.mjs, which is a copy of the same helpers in the MCP
// server: a parser bug found in one is worth carrying to the other.

// --- routes -----------------------------------------------------------------

/**
 * Pull one `export const NAME: Route[] = [...]` table out, entry by entry.
 *
 * Split by brace depth rather than matched with one regex across the whole
 * table. A `/method:.*?pattern:/` over the flat text is correct only while
 * every entry happens to write its method first: reorder two fields and the
 * lazy match joins one entry's method to the next entry's pattern. What comes
 * out is a route neither table has — and a route that is in neither is not a
 * failure here, it is silence. A checker whose failure mode is a false
 * all-clear is worse than no checker, which is what the brace walk is for.
 *
 * Slicing the entry is only half of it. Within one entry the fields are read at
 * that entry's own depth, because a nested literal can quote a `pattern` of its
 * own — an options bag, a `handler: {}` with a path in it — and a regex over
 * the entry takes whichever comes first.
 *
 * The split itself is `entries`, which skips literals rather than counting
 * every brace it sees. A raw count is the same bug one level down: a lone `}`
 * in a string desyncs the depth for good, and the entries after it are dropped
 * without a word.
 *
 * The `!routes.size` guard below only catches a parse that found nothing at
 * all, which is exactly what a mispaired parse is not.
