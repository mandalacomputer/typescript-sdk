/**
 * Refuse to publish the platform's internals from this public repository.
 *
 * This repo is public. The platform it speaks to is not. Everything here is
 * written by reading that platform, and the reading leaves fingerprints — file
 * names, internal function names, quoted source comments — in comments that
 * SHIP: `dist/*.d.ts` carries every doc comment in `src/` to npm.
 *
 * OPL-4613 scrubbed forty-one of them out of this repo by hand and said in its
 * own commit message that the scan "wants to be a check rather than a one-off".
 * It stayed a one-off, seven survived it, and five more arrived this week in a
 * single batch of client fixes. This is that check (OPL-4636).
 *
 * WHAT IS FORBIDDEN, and it is deliberately narrow — this is not a secret
 * scanner:
 *
 *   - platform source paths: `server/<file>.go`, `web/lib/<file>.ts`
 *   - the internal identifiers listed below
 *   - nothing else. Prose about what the platform DOES is the point of this
 *     client's comments and must stay.
 *
 * WHAT TO WRITE INSTEAD: the caller-facing consequence. "The platform sets `id`
 * on every row it emits" says everything "`projection.ts` sets `id`..." said, to
 * a reader who is holding this library rather than casing the platform.
 *
 * WHAT IS ALLOWED THROUGH: `scripts/check-surface.mjs` and the tests around it
 * name the two platform files they READ. That was OPL-4613's judgement and it
 * holds — a tool that self-evidently reads a private repo is the weakest thing
 * on this list, and it already refuses to run against the platform in public CI.
 * Allowlisted by FILE, so a reference anywhere else still fails.
 *
 * Run over the working tree (`npm run check:internals`) or over commit messages
 * (`node scripts/check-internals.mjs --messages origin/main..HEAD`), which is
 * the half a file scan cannot see: a commit message is public the moment it is
 * pushed, and three of this week's five were in messages and PR descriptions.
