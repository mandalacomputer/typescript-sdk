/**
 * Refuse to publish the platform's internals from this public repository.
 *
 * This repo is public. The platform it speaks to is not. Everything here is
 * written by reading that platform, and the reading leaves fingerprints — file
 * names, internal function names, quoted source comments — in comments that
 * SHIP: `dist/*.d.ts` carries every doc comment to npm, and without
 * `removeComments` the `//` bodies go with it.
 *
 * WHY THIS IS A CHECK AND NOT ANOTHER SCRUB. OPL-4613 scrubbed forty-one of
 * these out of this repo and said in its own commit message that the scan
 * "wants to be a check rather than a one-off". It stayed a one-off. Seven
 * survived it and five more arrived the following week.
 *
 * WHY THE LIST IS NOT WRITTEN BY HAND. The first cut of this file listed the
 * names the scrub had just removed and certified the repo clean while more were
 * still shipping (/code-review). `internal-names.sha256` is DERIVED instead,
 * from the declarations in the platform's own source, by a script that lives
 * there. Regenerating it is a command rather than an act of memory.
 *
 * WHY THE NAMES ARE HASHED. A list of a private system's internal names,
 * published in a public repo, is a small map of that system. So this carries
 * SHA-256 prefixes. A match is still reported BY NAME, because the name is
 * already in the file being scanned; what this file cannot do is hand a reader
 * the set of names to go looking for.
 *
 * WHAT IS FORBIDDEN, and it is deliberately narrow — this is not a secret
 * scanner:
 *
 *   - platform source paths, BY SHAPE rather than by prefix. This client has no
 *     Go, so any `<something>.go` in it names somebody else's file; the first
 *     cut required a `server/` prefix and let a bare one ship in `dist/`.
 *     Likewise `lib/<module>` and `web/lib/<module>`, extension or not.
 *   - identifiers declared in the platform and not in this library.
 *   - nothing else. Prose about what the platform DOES is the point of this
 *     client's comments and must stay.
 *
 * WHAT TO WRITE INSTEAD: the caller-facing consequence. "The platform sets `id`
 * on every row it emits" says everything the internal spelling said, to a reader
 * holding this library rather than casing the platform.
 *
 * WHAT IS ALLOWED THROUGH: the surface checker and its tables, which mirror the
 * platform's routes and constants because that is their whole job, and which are
 * not shipped. Allowlisted BY FILE, so a reference anywhere else still fails.
 *
 * Run over the working tree (`npm run check:internals`) or over commit messages,
 * which is the half a file scan cannot see — a message is public the moment it
 * is pushed:
 *
 *   node scripts/check-internals.mjs --messages origin/main..HEAD
