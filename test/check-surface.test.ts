/**
 * The surface check's discovery and failure boundaries.
 *
 * Every test here asks the same question a different way: when
 * `scripts/check-surface.mjs` cannot read the platform's inventory, does it
 * FAIL, or does it print a number and exit 0?
 *
 * That question is the whole of OPL-4850. The reader this replaced scanned the
 * platform's TypeScript as text, and across eleven review rounds it produced at
 * least a dozen distinct fail-opens — runs that announced "the mirror matches
 * the platform" without having read it. Reading a generated JSON file removes
 * the grammar, but it does not by itself remove the failure mode: a missing key
 * read as an empty table, or an unknown version read as best-effort, is the
 * same green run over nothing.
 *
 * So the shape checks below are not defensive programming around a file we
 * control. They are the point.
 *
 * The script is spawned rather than imported, the way check-internals.test.ts
 * spawns its own: what is under test is the command the platform's CI runs,
 * exit code included.
